If you had told the 2013 version of me — a C#-writing, NUnit-debugging rookie at Alumnus Software Limited, Kolkata — that I’d one day be leading multiple cross-functional teams in Berlin, I probably would've just blinked, nodded, and gone back to debugging with a coffee. But here we are.

This post isn’t a blueprint for becoming a manager. It’s just my story — from breaking CI/CD in the early days to building it from scratch, from being too chill as a fresher to mentoring folks across countries.

#### 🏫 My (Not-So) Ordinary Beginning

I technically started working before I even graduated. Thanks to a placement offer from Alumnus, and a pretty chill final semester (sorry, professors!), I got permission from my college to skip classes and start my full-time job.

It was my first brush with the real world. Exciting? Definitely. Terrifying? Oh yes.

Within a year, though, reality hit. My first performance review was... let’s say “character-building.” My manager wasn’t thrilled that I was being too friendly with seniors and not behaving like a fresher. (Yes, that was the actual feedback.) That stung. But I got the message, shifted gears, and changed my attitude.

Fast forward six months — I was awarded "Exceptional Performance" by the same company. Redemption arc, unlocked.

#### 🛠️ My Foundation, My Forge

My real learning happened at Seamless Distribution Systems. That’s where I built my foundation — not just technically, but in how to think about systems, products, and teams.

Back in 2014, when Docker was still a fresh buzzword, I was already using it to create our first CI/CD pipeline. I didn’t fully grasp the impact back then, but looking back, that was my first “big” achievement. I still smile thinking about it.

At Seamless, I wore many hats — developer, lead, crisis manager, you name it. And in the process, I discovered how much I enjoyed mentoring and helping others unblock themselves.

#### 🛬 Berlin, Omio & Big Leagues

Moving to Berlin and joining Omio in 2019 opened a whole new chapter. I currently lead the App Growth team — a wonderful mix of engineers, PMs, and calendars full of back-to-back meetings.

My job today? A blend of strategy, mentoring, problem-solving, and the occasional `kubectl` command when nobody's watching.

#### 🤦‍♂️ From “Managers Do Nothing” to “Oh Wait…”

Let me be honest — when I was a software engineer, I used to think managers have the easiest job. I mean, they just assign tasks and attend meetings, right?

Wrong. So wrong.

As a manager, you’re accountable for results, but you’re not the one executing the tasks. It’s like trying to win a Quidditch match without flying the broom. Your success depends entirely on your team’s success, and your job is to enable, coach, clear the path, and — often — absorb the chaos.

#### 💡 Lessons Along the Way

- Don't underestimate feedback. Even the weirdest feedback might carry gold.
- Being a good engineer ≠ being a good lead. You grow into it, or you don’t — and that’s okay.
- The tech world rewards curiosity. Docker in 2014 changed my career trajectory.
- Being a manager isn’t about control. It’s about trust, clarity, and being the umbrella when it rains (which it does — often).

#### 👨‍💻 My Two Cents

If you're a solo dev thinking about leadership, give it a try — but not just for the title. Try it for the people part. For the long game. For the thrill of watching someone you mentored absolutely crush it in a demo.

And if you're already leading and feeling imposter-y... congratulations. That means you're thinking, growing, and doing it right.

#### 🎬 Curtain Call

From skipping college classes for a job, to failing my first review, to getting that first big break with CI/CD, to now building and leading growth-focused teams — it’s been one heck of a journey.

Would I do it again? Absolutely. But maybe I’d go a bit easier on being "too friendly" in the first year :)
