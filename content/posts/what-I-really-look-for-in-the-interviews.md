Over the years, I’ve interviewed a fair number of engineers — some fresh out of college, others with years of experience under their belts. The process has taught me one important truth: 

> Great candidates often reveal themselves between the lines.

It’s not just about ticking boxes or giving perfect answers. I’m more interested in how someone thinks, how they’ve navigated real-world complexity, and whether they’re curious enough to grow with the team.

Let me share what I really look for — not the exact questions, but the thought process behind them.

## 🌍 Do You *Really* Know Where You’re Applying?

If you’re applying for a role, I’m hoping you’ve looked us up. Not just a skim of the homepage, but a sense of what we do, how we operate, and where we stand in the industry.

That said, there was this one candidate who — when I asked about pros and cons of our product — just listed out all the **cons**. Every single one. And then casually added, “That’s why I want to join — to fix these.”  
Respect for the honesty. And for the guts.

## ⚙️ Real-Life Engineering > Textbook Definitions

Whether it’s agile, testing, analytics, or shipping features — I’m not checking if your answers match a certification guide. I’m more curious about how you’ve actually worked in those areas.

What worked? What didn’t? What did you learn the hard way?

## 🧠 Depth Over Drama

When I ask about a challenging task, I’m not fishing for a “saved the company in a weekend” story. It’s way more interesting when someone walks me through a real-world problem — something messy, unexpected, maybe even a little embarrassing — and shares how they navigated it.

Even better if they can talk about how technically demanding it was. Did they break it into manageable chunks? How did they prioritize under pressure? What got built first, and why? And if things started slipping, did they raise the alarm in time?

That blend of depth, structure, and courage tells me more than any perfectly polished end result.

## 🚀 Thoughtful Delivery Mindset

Shipping isn’t just “code complete.” It’s planning, testing, deploying, tracking, learning — and not setting production on fire in the process.

You don’t need to have launched billion-user features. I just want to know you think beyond the pull request.

## 📊 Tools Are Fine — Thinking Is Better

Sometimes I bring up tools we use. Not to quiz anyone, but to understand whether they know **why** such tools matter. Like, what insights do you seek? How do you decide what success even looks like?

## 🧩 Frontend, Backend — Lines Are Blurry Anyway

We work in cross-functional teams. Sometimes that means helping out on parts of the stack that aren’t your comfort zone.

If someone says, “I’m not the expert but I’m happy to learn,” that’s music to my ears.

## 🛠️ Process Is a Tool, Not a Goal

Whether it's JIRA, rituals, or release planning — process only works when it helps people work better. I like when someone has opinions on what makes things smoother, not heavier.

And yeah, I’ve seen a “perfect” JIRA card only once. It was a mirage. We’re all just trying our best.

## 😂 Some Honesty That Stuck With Me

One of the most honest answers I ever got was to the question, *“Why do you want to join us?”*  
The candidate said: *“I don’t really know anything about the company. The recruiter kind of pushed me into this.”*

I mean... 10/10 for honesty.  
0/10 for preparation.

## 🎯 In the End

I’m not looking for perfect answers. I’m looking for thoughtfulness, curiosity, and the kind of mindset that makes teams better — not just faster.
