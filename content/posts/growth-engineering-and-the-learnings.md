When I first moved into Growth Engineering, I thought I was just joining a different product team.

I didn’t expect the shift in mindset, speed, or even the way we defined “done.”  
Looking back now — after three years of managing the App Growth team at Omio — I realise how different this world really is.

Not better. Not worse. Just different.  
And those differences taught me a lot.

## Product Engineering vs Growth Engineering

Most engineers I know are wired for impact.  
But *how* that impact shows up — that varies widely between Product and Growth teams.

Here’s what stood out for me:

- **Product Engineering** is about building strong, scalable features that solve core user problems.  
- **Growth Engineering** is about identifying and removing friction from the user journey — often in smaller, scrappier, more measurable ways.

In Growth, the question isn’t “Is this feature complete?”  
It’s “Did this experiment move the metric?”

We build, ship, and measure — often in shorter loops, with faster learnings, and sometimes with throwaway code that did its job and moved on.

## It’s Not Just Engineering

What surprised me the most was how *cross-functional* growth work really is.

Our team works with:

- Product managers (of course),
- But also CRM teams, SEO, ASO, Analytics,
- And sometimes — performance marketing or even customer support.

It’s a space where engineers don’t just build systems — they help design experiments, interpret data, write copy, and sometimes even suggest subject lines for push notifications.

It’s less “backlog grooming,” more “how fast can we test this idea and learn something?”

## The Tradeoffs

Growth work often demands speed. But that doesn’t mean chaos.

We still care about clean code.  
We still write tests.  
We still review PRs with the same attention.

But we also accept that:

- Some experiments won’t go to production.
- Some code may live for just two weeks.
- Some bets won’t pay off — and that’s okay.

You learn to optimise for *learning velocity*, not just system stability.  
It’s not about perfect — it’s about *clear enough to ship, clean enough to scale if it works*.


## My Biggest Learnings

Leading this team taught me to zoom out. To obsess less about what we’re building, and more about *why* we’re building it.

Some reflections that stuck:

- Experiments are only useful if we actually learn from them.
- Sometimes, a copy tweak moves the needle more than a new feature.
- Engineers who understand data become incredibly powerful on Growth teams.
- “This doesn’t scale” is fine — if you’re not scaling it yet.

I also learned that some of the best product instincts come from places outside engineering. From a CRM specialist who notices a drop-off in reactivations. Or from a marketer who sees a trend before it hits the dashboard.

## Lastly

Working on a Growth team changed how I think about product development.  
It made me quicker to ask *what problem are we solving*, and slower to assume the solution.

If someone asks me about Growth Engineering, I’d say this:

It’s not a different skill set.  
It’s a different lens.  
And sometimes, it’s the fastest way to get closer to impact.
