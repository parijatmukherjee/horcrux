Hi, I’m **Parijat** — software engineer by trade, **Engineering Manager** by evolution, **musician** by passion, and occasionally the guy who breaks production right before a demo (we’ve all been there).

I started my tech journey before even graduating, sneaking into the industry with a keyboard in one hand and a college ID in the other. Over the years, I’ve coded, debugged, deployed, led teams, and discovered that managing engineers is a whole different game — one that’s more about people, context-switching, and finding the right emoji for feedback.

Currently based in **Berlin**, I lead talented folks at Omio, help systems scale, unblock humans, and occasionally explain why a “tiny design tweak” in the React Native app isn’t exactly a 15-minute task.

When I’m not in stand-ups or 1:1s, I’m usually:

- **Travelling** or out on a **road trip**
- **Playing guitar** and pretending I know all the chords
- **Gossiping with friends** (yes, it’s a productivity hack — don’t @ me)

If this site feels like a mix of blog, portfolio, and digital journal — that’s exactly what it is.

Feel free to explore. No passwords needed, just curiosity.
