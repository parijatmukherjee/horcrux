If you’ve ever been in a meeting where no one knows who’s actually responsible for anything — congrats, you’ve likely brushed up against what I call *the accountability Bermuda Triangle*.

This post isn’t a leadership roast (well, maybe a light toasting). It’s an observation I’ve seen across roles, companies, and coffee-fueled war rooms: when leadership quietly backs away from owning outcomes, and teams are left juggling flaming torches while blindfolded.

Let’s talk about what that looks like, and how some folks still manage to thrive in that chaos.

## 🪧 Spot the Signs: The “Not My Problem” Playbook

### 1. The Ownership Black Hole  

Projects float around without an owner. Everyone’s “involved,” but no one’s responsible. The moment things go sideways? Radio silence at the top.

### 2. Numbers Become a Blame Game  

Metrics are important — we all get that. But when dashboards turn into dartboards, and context is thrown out the window, it stops being data-driven and starts feeling like damage control.

### 3. “You’re Smart, Figure It Out”  

Strategic decisions trickle down with zero clarity or support. It’s like being handed IKEA parts with no manual — but the deadline’s still Friday.

### 4. Reorg Roulette  

Every few months, new structure, new faces, same problems. If it feels like leadership is rearranging the chairs instead of fixing the leak… well, yeah.

### 5. Praise Goes Up, Blame Rolls Down  

Classic. Teams carry the weight, but leadership basks in the limelight. Failures? That’s apparently a “team learning opportunity.” Cute.

## 🤔 Why This Even Happens

- **Fear of looking bad** — so the safest move is no move at all.  
- **Unclear direction** — if there’s no real strategy, execution becomes a guessing game.  
- **Incentives misaligned** — when “looking busy” beats “driving impact,” weird stuff starts to feel normal.  
- **Silos galore** — less cross-talk means more finger-pointing when things break.

## 🛠️ So… What Now?

Let’s say you’re in this mess. Maybe not *starring* in it, but definitely an unwilling extra. Here are some things that helped me (and others) navigate the nonsense:

### 1. Find Your People  

Your peer group is your oxygen. Trusted teammates and fellow survivors make everything feel less personal, and a lot more manageable.

### 2. Write Stuff Down  

No, not to be petty — but documenting decisions, discussions, and expectations helps everyone stay sane when the memory fog sets in.

### 3. Quietly Lead Anyway  

Even if your job title doesn’t scream “boss,” stepping up, creating clarity, and unblocking others makes you someone worth following.

### 4. Manage Up (Without Sounding Like a Jerk)  

Bring solutions, not just problems. Say, “Here’s what we’re seeing and how we could fix it,” instead of “Why is everything on fire?”

### 5. Protect the Team  

If you lead people, they need clarity. Even if you're still figuring it out, giving them context and shielding them from top-down whiplash helps more than you think.

### 6. Keep That Exit Door Visible  

If all else fails — and some cultures just don’t want to change — don’t set yourself on fire to keep a broken org warm. Keep an eye on opportunities that align better with your values.

## 🎤 Before I Drop the Mic

Not all great leaders have fancy titles. And not all fancy-titled folks lead. Sometimes, the real leaders are buried two layers deep, making sure their team doesn’t burn out — or burn bridges — while still shipping good work.

If you’re in a place where responsibility feels like a hot potato, and you’re the one catching it every time… know this: you’re not alone, and there are ways to win even when the system feels stacked.

And hey — if one day you *are* at the top? Don’t forget what this felt like.

Be the leader who holds the line, not the one who ducks behind it.
